# AI Practitioner Certification

Those documentations are for AWS AI Practitioner Certification based on Skill Builder course at [AWS Skill Builder](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/127/aws-certified-ai-practitioner).

## Description

Generative AI is a branch of artificial intelligence that focus on creating new content, such as text, images, audio, or even computer code, from existing data. Those are the similarities and differences between those technologies:
- `Artificial Intelligence (AI)`: AI is a broad field that encompasses the development of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and natural language understanding. Generative AI is a subset of AI that specifically
- `Machine Learning (ML)`: ML is a type of AI for understanding and building methods that make it possible for machines to learn.
- `Deep Leainig (DL)`: DL uses the concept of neurons and synapses similar to how our brain is wired.
- `Generative AI`: Generative AI is subset of deep learning because it can adapt models built using deep learning, but without retraining or fine tuning the model.

## Machine Learning fundamentals:

Building a machine learning involves data collection and preparation, selecting an appropriate algorithm, training the model on the prepared data, and evaluating its performance through testing and iteration.
